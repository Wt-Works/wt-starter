wt-starter
==========

A Combined Evaluation and Teach-In to "wt", the C++ Web Toolkit" (http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt).

The current Assessment is:

* usable for small-scale embedded projects and low user-count web-applications
* use the widget based UI system, avoid use of Database Module (Dbo)

Issues
------

The "Rejected" and "Closed" issues showcase the quality of the team:

http://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues?author_id=2762&per_page=100

A main deficit is the very low quality of the project-resources. Even issues which are obvious, and take only a few minutes to solve, remain unprocessed:

[[PROJECT] Issues should have Categories](http://redmine.webtoolkit.eu/issues/2715)

Despite emweb is charging for a commercial license (= commercial product), the documentation has no commercial-grade quality.

 
Basic Teach-In
--------------

The wt sources contain examples and documentation which are not always very clear. This is mainly due to the fact that the library authors wrote this documentation themselves.

Another problem is the build-system, which makes it difficult to use the examples stand-alone.

This "Starter" tries to overcome the above two barriers, providing simple examples with nice clean code. Additionally, the examples are kept as much as possible independently.


Installation
------------

Install wt on your system:

Windows: use the binary installer, the set the environment variable WT_INSTALL_DIR
