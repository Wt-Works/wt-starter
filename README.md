wt-starter
==========

A Project which simplifies the Getting Started with the "wt", the C++ Web Toolkit" (http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt)


 
Basics
------

The wt sources contain examples and documentation which are not always very clear. This is mainly due to the fact that the library authors wrote this documentation themselves.

Another problem is the build-system, which makes it difficult to use the examples stand-alone.

This "Starter" tries to overcome the above two barriers, providing simple examples with nice clean code. Additionally, the examples are kept as much as possible independently.


Installation
------------

Install wt on your system:

Windows: use the binary installer, the set the environment variable WT_INSTALL_DIR
